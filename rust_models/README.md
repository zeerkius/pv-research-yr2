This is just a collections of the models used for the above analysis. Models have been developed in rust and are referenced in https://github.com/zeerkius/Machine-Learning-In-Rust.git
There will be a copy of the src code and Cargo used for those who wish to build the project again.
Here will also have the Random model we will use to generate a baseline for models developed , as well as full models results in terms of Test accuracy , Sensitivity , Precison , MCC , and Chi-Squared Signifigance against random models.
Further Analysis on splits between the data for testing and training will be displayed as well as the target distribution in both data-sets.
